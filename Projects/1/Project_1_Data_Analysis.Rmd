# Project 1 - Data Analysis
This is Project 1 for DATA 607. 

##  Overview
In this project, we were given a text file with chess tournament results where the information had a cross-table structure. Our job was to create an R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could for example be imported into a SQL database)
with the following information for all of the players:

- Player’s Name
- Player’s State
- Total Number of Points
- Player’s Pre-Rating
- Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents

Here is an example of what the file looks like:

## Read in data
```{r read-in-text-data}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinm0rgan/data607/main/Projects/1/data/7645617.txt", show_col_types = F, skip = 1)
```

## Create dataframe

Create empty data frame with correct data types and final structure.
```{r create-empty-df}
df2 <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 6, nrow = 64))
colnames(df2) <- c("num", "name", "state", "total_pts", "pre_rating", "avg_rating_opp")
```

## Clean data

Steps to clean data:
### 1. Filter every 3rd row to exclude dashed line
```{r filter-rows}
df <- df %>% 
  filter((row_number() %% 3 == 0) | (row_number() %% 3 == !0))
```

Preview df
```{r}
df
```
### 2. Isolate rows with `num`, `name` and `total_pts` data.
Use `regex` to extract appropriate data for each column.
```{r get-num-name-pts}
df_num_name_pts <-  df %>% 
  filter(row_number() %% 2 == 0)

df_num_name_pts
```
```{r get-num-col}
df2$num <- df_num_name_pts$`Pair | Player Name                     |Total|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|` %>% 
  str_extract("^.{2}") %>% 
  trimws() %>% 
  as.numeric()
```

```{r get-name-col}
df2$name <- df_num_name_pts$`Pair | Player Name                     |Total|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|` %>% 
  str_extract("([A-Z]+\\s[A-Z]+) | ([A-Z]+\\s[A-Z]+\\s[A-Z]+)") %>% 
  trimws()
```

```{r get-pts-col}
df2$total_pts <- df_num_name_pts$`Pair | Player Name                     |Total|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|` %>% 
  str_extract("\\d\\.\\d") %>% 
  as.numeric()
```

### 3. Isolate rows with `state` and `pre_rating`.
```{r get-state-pre-rating}
df_get_state_pre <- df[-1,] #delete first row
df_get_state_pre <- df_get_state_pre %>%   
  filter(row_number() %% 2 == 0)

head(df_get_state_pre)
```

```{r get-state}
df2$state <- df_get_state_pre$`Pair | Player Name                     |Total|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|` %>% 
  str_extract("[A-Z]+")
```

```{r get-pre-rating}
df2$pre_rating <- df_get_state_pre$`Pair | Player Name                     |Total|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|` %>% 
  str_extract("(\\d+).*?(\\d+)") %>% 
  str_sub(15,19) %>% 
  trimws() %>% 
  as.numeric()
```

###4. Create data frame to calculate `avg_rating_opp` and add to main data frame.
```{r create-opponents-df}
# extract rounds with opponent numbers
df_opp <- df_num_name_pts$`Pair | Player Name                     |Total|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|Round|` %>% 
  str_extract_all("\\s\\d{1,2}.*", simplify = T) %>% 
  data.frame()

# create oppoenent df
df_opp <- read.csv(text=sub(
  "\\s+(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)$", 
  ",\\1,\\2,\\3,\\4,\\5,\\6", df_opp$.), 
        col.names=c('rnd1', 'rnd2', 'rnd3','rnd4','rnd5','rnd6','rnd7'), header=FALSE)

# set player id
df_opp$player_id <- 1:nrow(df_opp)

# rearrange
df_opp <- df_opp %>% 
  select(player_id, rnd1, rnd2, rnd3, rnd4, rnd5, rnd6, rnd7)

df_opp
```

```{r create-df-player-opponent}
# extract numbers from each column
df_opp <- df_opp %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = rnd1:rnd7, .fns=str_extract, pattern = "\\d+"))

#  change dtype of columns to numeric
df_opp <- df_opp %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = rnd1:rnd7, .fns = as.numeric))

df_opp
```
```{r join-df}
# join to look up pre-rating
df_opp <- left_join(df_opp, df2, by = c("player_id" = "num"))

# select only columns needed
df_opp <- df_opp %>% 
  select(player_id, pre_rating, rnd1, rnd2, rnd3, rnd4, rnd5, rnd6, rnd7)

df_opp
```

Maybe write a custom function to look up the values of all the pre-ratings.

```{r}
df2
```
